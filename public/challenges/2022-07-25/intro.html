    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Given two arrays A and B, return the indices at which the two arrays intersect. If the two arrays have no intersection at all, return null. Extra credit: how would you change your code if they were linked lists instead of arrays, if the input were the two head nodes, and you returned the intersection node?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>let listA = [1,4,5,6]
let listB = [2,3,4,5,6]

&gt; findIntersection(listA, listB)
&gt; [1, 2]</pre></div>
