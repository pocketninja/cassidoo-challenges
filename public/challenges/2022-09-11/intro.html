    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Remember the bouncing DVD logo? Given the dimensions of the logo, its initial coordinates, and the size of a screen, write a function that will determine if its next collision will hit the corner of the screen. Assume it is initially moving southeast with a slope of -1. Extra credit, figure out how many bounces/collisions it will take to hit a corner!</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>let dimensions = [5,5]
let initialCoordinates = [0,0] // you decide which part of the logo the coords map to
let screenSize = [100,100]

&gt; cornerHit(dimensions, initialCoordinates, screenSize)
&gt; true // in one collision

&gt; cornerHit(dimensions, [45,70], [400,200])
&gt; false</pre></div>
