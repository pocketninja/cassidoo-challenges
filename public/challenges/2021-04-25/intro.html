    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Given a string of brackets, return a rotation of those brackets that is balanced. The numbers of opening and closing brackets will always be equal, so [ or ][] wonâ€™t be given as inputs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$ rotateBrackets(']][][[')
$ '[[]][]' // First rotation yields '[]][]['. Second one yields '[[]][]'.</p>
