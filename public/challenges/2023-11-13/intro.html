    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Given a list of tasks, where each task has a duration, and a limited amount of available time to work, write a function to return the tasks that can be completed within the given time, without re-ordering the original list of tasks. Try to maximize the number of tasks that can be completed!</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>const tasks = [
  { name: &#039;Task 1&#039;, duration: 4 },
  { name: &#039;Task 2&#039;, duration: 2 },
  { name: &#039;Task 3&#039;, duration: 7 },
  { name: &#039;Task 4&#039;, duration: 5 },
  { name: &#039;Task 5&#039;, duration: 1 },
  { name: &#039;Task 6&#039;, duration: 3 }
];

const timeToWork = 6;

&gt; doTasks(tasks, timeToWork)
&gt; [&#039;Task 2&#039;, &#039;Task 5&#039;, &#039;Task 6&#039;]</pre></div>
