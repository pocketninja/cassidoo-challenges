Given a file named merry-christmas.txt that has a single integer x in it, write a script to generate a Christmas tree with asterisks (*) and output it as happy-holidays.txt. The tree should have a height of x, and if merry-christmas.txt is empty, the height should be 25 asterisks tall.</p>
<p>Example (you can be flexible with your output, but this might be helpful for you as a starting point):</p>
<pre>// merry-christmas.txt

// happy-holidays.txt
