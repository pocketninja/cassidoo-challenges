    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Given a room size, and the square footage a paint can can cover, return how many cans of paint you need to buy to paint a room. Assume the room has four walls. If youâ€™d like to expand this, you can add doors, windows, or any other room features that might make the problem interesting to solve.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>room = { length: 12, width: 10, height: 9 }
canCoverage = 200
$ numberOfCans(room, canCoverage)
$ 2 // (12x9x2)+(10x9x2) = 396, so two cans will cover it</p></div>
