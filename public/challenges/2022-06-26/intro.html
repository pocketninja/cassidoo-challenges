    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>Given a string str and a set of words dict, find the longest word in dict that is a subsequence of str.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>let str = &quot;abppplee&quot;
let dict = {&quot;able&quot;, &quot;ale&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bale&quot;, &quot;kangaroo&quot;}

$ longestWord(str, dict)
$ &#039;apple&#039;
// &quot;able&quot; and &quot;ale&quot; also work, but are shorter than &quot;apple&quot;
// &quot;bale&quot; has all the right letters, but not in the right order</pre></div>
