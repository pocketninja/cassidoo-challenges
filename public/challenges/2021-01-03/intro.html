    <div class="challenge-intro__description"><p>(thanks to Tom!):
You‚Äôre trying to build an IoT mesh network. Signals can only travel the maximum of 5 units. You‚Äôre given coordinates for the switch, the light, and the mesh hubs (which capture and forward signals). Return true if the switch can successfully toggle the light.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>let network = { switch: [0,1], hub: [[2,1], [2,5]], light: [1,6] }
$ canToggle(network)
$ true</p>
<p>If you want a more visual example, here‚Äôs a diagram. In this example, canToggle would return false because the red circles don‚Äôt connect in the middle, with the blue triangle being the switch, and the green being the light!</p></div>
