Extra credit: how would you change your code if they were linked lists instead of arrays, if the input were the two head nodes, and you returned the intersection node?<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<pre>let listA = [1,4,5,6]\nlet listB = [2,3,4,5,6]\n\n&gt; findIntersection(listA, listB)\n&gt; [1, 2]<\/pre>",
