    "content": "<p>The game Rummikub has 106 tiles: 8 sets numbered 1-13, colored red, blue, black, and yellow, and two (2) \"wildcard\" tiles.\nWrite two functions: one that creates a new player's tray of 14 tiles (repetitions allowed), and one that returns the valid sets from a given tray. A set can be either 3 or 4 tiles of the same number (but all different colors), or it can be a \"run\" (which is three or more consecutive numbers all in the same color). The rules for Rummikub are here if you need more clarification!<\/p>",
