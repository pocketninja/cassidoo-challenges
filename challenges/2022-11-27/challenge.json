Capital letters represent white pieces, lowercase letters represent black pieces, where P is a white pawn, n is a black knight, K is a white king, and so on. A ~ represents a blank square, and you can use this tool if you need a helpful visual! You can choose to do absolute coordinates or relative ones, and decide how you want to differentiate between duplicate pieces.<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<pre>let board =\n    [`~~~~~~~~\n      ~~kb~~~~\n      ~~K~~~~~\n      ~~~~~~~~\n      ~~~~~~~~\n      ~~~~~~~~\n      ~~~~~~~~\n      ~~~R~~~~`]\n\n&gt; isValidMove(board, &#039;R&#039;, [0,0])\n&gt; false \/\/ A rook can only move horizontally and vertically\n\n&gt; isValidMove(board, &#039;k&#039;, [0,1])\n&gt; true \/\/ A king can move one square at a time in any direction\n\n&gt; isValidMove(board, &#039;Q&#039;, [5,7])\n&gt; false \/\/ The queen is not on the board<\/pre>",
